A Douyu VOD browser to more easily track CN WoW streamers.

There are many amazing CN WoW players who stream on sites like Douyu, Huya and Bilibili. It can be hard to find their streams / VODs for us Western folk, as even Google Translate doesn't make it obvious and you just kind of have to know what/who you are looking for.

The point of this web app is to just colocate a few popular CN WoW streamers in one place. Currently it previews the last 10 VODs of each stream as well as provides links to their full Live Replay and Live page.

Currently in progess: ability to add your own streams to track. Should be released soon!
